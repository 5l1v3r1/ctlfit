	volume = {82},
	doi = {10.1128/JVI.02552-07},
	abstract = {Infections with human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} and the closely related monkey viruses simian-human immunodeficiency virus ({SHIV)} and simian immunodeficiency virus ({SIV)} are characterized by progressive waves of immune responses, followed by viral mutation and “immune escape.” However, escape mutation usually leads to lower replicative fitness, and in the absence of immune pressure, an escape mutant ({EM)} virus “reverts” to the wild-type phenotype. Analysis of the dynamics of immune escape and reversion has suggested it is a mechanism for identifying the immunogens best capable of controlling viremia. We have analyzed and modeled data of the dynamics of wild-type ({WT)} and {EM} viruses during {SHIV} infection of macaques. Modeling suggests that the dynamics of reversion and immune escape should be determined by the availability of target cells for infection. Consistent with this suggestion, we find that the rate of reversion of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ({CTL)} {EM} virus strongly correlates with the number of {CD4+} T cells available for infection. This phenomenon also affects the rate of immune escape, since this rate is determined by the balance of {CTL} killing and the {WT} fitness advantage. This analysis predicts that the optimal timing for the selection of immune escape variants will be immediately after the peak of viremia and that the development of escape variants at later times will lead to slower selection. This has important implications for comparative studies of immune escape and reversion in different infections and for identifying epitopes with high fitness cost for use as vaccine targets.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.tpb.2009.02.006},
	abstract = {Complex traits often involve interactions between different genetic loci. This can lead to sign epistasis, whereby mutations that are individually deleterious or neutral combine to confer a fitness benefit. In order to acquire the beneficial genotype, an asexual population must cross a fitness valley or plateau by first acquiring the deleterious or neutral intermediates. Here, we present a complete, intuitive theoretical description of the valley-crossing process across the full spectrum of possible parameter regimes. We calculate the rate at which a population crosses a fitness valley or plateau of arbitrary width, as a function of the mutation rates, the population size, and the fitnesses of the intermediates. We find that when intermediates are close to neutral, a large population can cross even wide fitness valleys remarkably quickly, so that valley-crossing dynamics may be common even when mutations that directly increase fitness are also possible. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of large populations can be sensitive to the structure of an extended region of the fitness landscape — the population may not take directly uphill paths in favor of paths across valleys and plateaus that lead eventually to fitter genotypes. In smaller populations, we find that below a threshold size, which depends on the width of the fitness valley and the strength of selection against intermediate genotypes, valley-crossing is much less likely and hence the evolutionary dynamics are less influenced by distant regions of the fitness landscape.},

In recent years, methods have been developed that use escape mutation data to estimate rates of {HIV} escape, thereby providing a quantitative framework for exploring {HIV} escape from {CTL} response. Current methods for escape rate inference focus on a specific {HIV} mutant selected by a single {CTL} response. However, recent studies have shown that during the first weeks of infection, {CTL} responses occur at 1 — 3 epitopes and {HIV} escape occurs through complex mutation pathways. Consequently, {HIV} escape from {CTL} response forms a complex, selective sweep that is difficult to analyze. In this work, we develop a model of initial infection, based on the well-known standard model, that allows for a description of multi-epitope response and the complex mutation pathways of {HIV} escape. Under this model, we develop Bayesian and hypothesis test inference methods that allow us to analyze and estimate {HIV} escape rates. The methods are applied to two {HIV} patient datasets, concretely demonstrating the utility of our approach.},

abstract = {In order to develop a better understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of HIV drug resistance, it is necessary to quantify accurately the in vivo fitness costs of resistance mutations. However, the reliable estimation of such fitness costs is riddled with both theoretical and experimental difficulties. Experimental fitness assays typically suffer from the shortcoming that they are based on in vitro data. Fitness estimates based on the mathematical analysis of in vivo data, however, are often questionable because the underlying assumptions are not fulfilled. In particular, the assumption that the replication rate of the virus population is constant in time is frequently grossly violated. By extending recent work of Mar{\'e}e and colleagues, we present here a new approach that corrects for time-dependent viral replication in time-series data for growth competition of mutants. This approach allows a reliable estimation of the relative replicative capacity (with confidence intervals) of two competing virus variants growing within the same patient, using longitudinal data for the total plasma virus load, the relative frequency of the two variants and the death rate of infected cells. We assess the accuracy of our method using computer-generated data. An implementation of the developed method is freely accessible on the Web (http://www.eco.ethz.ch/fitness.html).},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btr722},
	abstract = {Motivation: The observation of positive selection acting on a mutant indicates that the corresponding mutation has some form of functional relevance. Determining the fitness effects of mutations thus has relevance to many interesting biological questions. One means of identifying beneficial mutations in an asexual population is to observe changes in the frequency of marked subsets of the population. We here describe a method to estimate the establishment times and fitnesses of beneficial mutations from neutral marker frequency data.
Results: The method accurately reproduces complex marker frequency trajectories. In simulations for which positive selection is close to 5\% per generation, we obtain correlations upwards of 0.91 between correct and inferred haplotype establishment times. Where mutation selection coefficients are exponentially distributed, the inferred distribution of haplotype fitnesses is close to being correct. Applied to data from a bacterial evolution experiment, our method reproduces an observed correlation between evolvability and initial fitness defect.

abstract = {Escape from specific T-cell responses contributes to the progression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. T-cell escape viral variants are retained following {HIV-1} transmission between major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched individuals. However, reversion to wild type can occur following transmission to MHC-mismatched hosts in the absence of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) pressure, due to the reduced fitness of the escape mutant virus. We estimated both the strength of immune selection and the fitness cost of escape variants by studying the rates of T-cell escape and reversion in pigtail macaques. Near-complete replacement of wild-type with T-cell escape viral variants at an immunodominant simian immunodeficiency virus Gag epitope KP9 occurred rapidly (over 7 days) following infection of pigtail macaques with SHIVSF162P3. Another challenge virus, SHIVmn229, previously serially passaged through pigtail macaques, contained a KP9 escape mutation in 40/44 clones sequenced from the challenge stock. When six KP9-responding animals were infected with this virus, the escape mutation was maintained. By contrast, in animals not responding to KP9, rapid reversion of the K165R mutation occurred over 2 weeks after infection. The rapidity of reversion to the wild-type sequence suggests a significant fitness cost of the T-cell escape mutant. Quantifying both the selection pressure exerted by CTL and the fitness costs of escape mutation has important implications for the development of CTL-based vaccine strategies.},

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation ({ABC)} constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. {ABC} methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, {ABC} methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. {ABC} methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of {ABC} exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. {ABC} has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

The standard model of infection has been used to estimate the basic reproductive ratio of the virus, calculated from the growth rate of virus in acute infection. This method has not been useful in studying the effects of vaccination, since, for the vaccines developed so far, early growth rates of virus do not differ between control and vaccinated animals. Here, we use the standard model of viral dynamics to derive the reproductive ratio from the peak viral load and nadir of target cell numbers in acute infection. We apply this method to data from studies of vaccination in {SHIV} and {SIV} infection and demonstrate that vaccination can reduce the reproductive ratio by 2.3- and 2-fold, respectively. This method allows the comparison of vaccination efficacies among different viral strains and animal models in vivo.},

	abstract = {Forty million people are estimated to be infected with {HIV-1}, and only a small fraction of those have access to life-prolonging antiretroviral treatment. As the epidemic grows there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines. Nonhuman primate models of immunodeficiency virus infection are essential for the preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines. To interpret the results of these trials, comparative studies of the human and macaque immune responses are needed. Despite the widespread use of macaques to evaluate vaccines designed to elicit a {CD8+} cytotoxic T lymphocyte ({CTL)} response, the efficiency with which {CTL} control immunodeficiency virus infections has not been compared between humans and macaques, largely because of difficulties in assaying the functional {CTL} response. We recently developed a method for estimating the rate at which {CTLs} kill cells productively infected with {HIV-1} in humans in vivo. Here, using the same technique, we quantify the rate at which {CTLs} kill infected cells in macaque models of {HIV} infection. We show that {CTLs} kill productively infected cells significantly faster (P = 0.004) and that escape variants have significantly higher fitness costs (P = 0.003) in macaques compared with humans. These results suggest that it may be easier to elicit a protective {CTL} response in macaques than in humans and that vaccine studies conducted in macaques need to be interpreted accordingly.},

	abstract = {Mutations that allow {SIV/HIV} to avoid the cytotoxic T lymphocyte ({CTL)} response are well documented. Recently, there have been a few attempts at estimating the costs of {CTL} escape mutations in terms of the reduction in viral fitness and the killing rate at which the {CTL} response specific to one viral epitope clears virus-infected cells. Using a mathematical model we show that estimation of both parameters depends critically on the underlying changes in the replication rate of the virus and the changes in the killing rate over time (which in previous studies were assumed to be constant). We provide a theoretical basis for estimation of these parameters using in vivo data. In particular, we show that 1) by assuming unlimited virus growth one can obtain a minimal estimate of the fitness cost of the escape mutation, and 2) by assuming no virus growth during the escape, one can obtain a minimal estimate of the average killing rate. We also discuss the conditions under which better estimates of the average killing rate can be obtained.},

Here, we developed a mathematical model of random viral evolution and, together with phylogenetic tree construction, used it to analyze 3,449 complete env sequences derived by single genome amplification from 102 subjects with acute {HIV-1} (clade B) infection. Viral env genes evolving from individual transmitted or founder viruses generally exhibited a Poisson distribution of mutations and star-like phylogeny, which coalesced to an inferred consensus sequence at or near the estimated time of virus transmission. Overall, 78 of 102 subjects had evidence of productive clinical infection by a single virus, and 24 others had evidence of productive clinical infection by a minimum of two to five viruses. Phenotypic analysis of transmitted or early founder Envs revealed a consistent pattern of {CCR5} dependence, masking of coreceptor binding regions, and equivalent or modestly enhanced resistance to the fusion inhibitor T1249 and broadly neutralizing antibodies compared with Envs from chronically infected subjects. Low multiplicity infection and limited viral evolution preceding peak viremia suggest a finite window of potential vulnerability of {HIV-1} to vaccine-elicited immune responses, although phenotypic properties of transmitted Envs pose a formidable defense.},

	abstract = {Blood plasma viral loads and the time to progress to {AIDS} differ widely among untreated {HIV-infected} humans. Although people with certain {HLA} ({HLA-I)} alleles are more likely to control {HIV} infections without therapy, the majority of such untreated individuals exhibit high viral loads and progress to {AIDS.} Stochastic effects are considered unimportant for evolutionary dynamics in {HIV-infected} people when viral load is high or when selective forces strongly drive mutation. We describe a computational study of host–pathogen interaction demonstrating that stochastic effects can have a profound influence on disease dynamics, even in cases of high viral load and strong selective pressure. These stochastic effects are pronounced when the virus must traverse a fitness “barrier” in sequence space to escape the host’s cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ({CTL)} response, as often occurs when a fitness defect imposed by a {CTL-driven} mutation must be compensated for by other mutations. These “barrier-crossing” events are infrequent and stochastic, resulting in divergent disease outcomes in genetically identical individuals infected by the same viral strain. Our results reveal how genetic determinants of the {CTL} response control the probability with which an individual is able to control {HIV} infection indefinitely, and thus provide clues for vaccine design.},

	abstract = {{HIV-1} often evades cytotoxic T cell ({CTL)} responses by generating variants that are not recognized by {CTLs.} We used single-genome amplification and sequencing of complete {HIV} genomes to identify longitudinal changes in the transmitted/founder virus from the establishment of infection to the viral set point at 1 year after the infection. We found that the rate of viral escape from {CTL} responses in a given patient decreases dramatically from acute infection to the viral set point. Using a novel mathematical model that tracks the dynamics of viral escape at multiple epitopes, we show that a number of factors could potentially contribute to a slower escape in the chronic phase of infection, such as a decreased magnitude of epitope-specific {CTL} responses, an increased fitness cost of escape mutations, or an increased diversity of the {CTL} response. In the model, an increase in the number of epitope-specific {CTL} responses can reduce the rate of viral escape from a given epitope-specific {CTL} response, particularly if {CD8+} T cells compete for killing of infected cells or control virus replication nonlytically. Our mathematical framework of viral escape from multiple {CTL} responses can be used to predict the breadth and magnitude of {HIV-specific} {CTL} responses that need to be induced by vaccination to reduce (or even prevent) viral escape following {HIV} infection.},

title = {Rapid reversion of sequence polymorphisms dominates early human immunodeficiency virus type 1 evolution},
abstract = {The error-prone replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) enables it to continuously evade host CD8+ T-cell responses. The observed transmission, and potential accumulation, of CD8+ T-cell escape mutations in the population may suggest a gradual adaptation of HIV-1 to immune pressures. Recent reports, however, have highlighted the propensity of some escape mutations to revert upon transmission to a new host in order to restore efficient replication capacity. To more specifically address the role of reversions in early HIV-1 evolution, we examined sequence polymorphisms arising across the HIV-1 genome in seven subjects followed longitudinally 1 year from primary infection. As expected, numerous nonsynonymous mutations were associated with described CD8+ T-cell epitopes, supporting a prominent role for cellular immune responses in driving early HIV-1 evolution. Strikingly, however, a substantial proportion of substitutions (42%) reverted toward the clade B consensus sequence, with nearly one-quarter of them located within defined CD8 epitopes not restricted by the contemporary host's HLA. More importantly, these reversions arose significantly faster than forward mutations, with the most rapidly reverting mutations preferentially arising within structurally conserved residues. These data suggest that many transmitted mutations likely incur a fitness cost that is recovered through retrieval of an optimal, or ancestral, form of the virus. The propensity of mutations to revert may limit the accumulation of immune pressure-driven mutations in the population, thus preserving critical CD8+ T-cell epitopes as vaccine targets, and argue against an unremitting adaptation of HIV-1 to host immune pressures.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of a population with many polymorphic loci is challenging, as a large number of possible genotypes needs to be tracked. In the absence of analytical solutions, forward computer simulations are an important tool in multi-locus population genetics. The run time of standard algorithms to simulate sexual populations increases as {8L} with the number of loci L, or with the square of the population size N.
Results: We have developed algorithms to simulate large populations with arbitrary genetic maps, including multiple crossovers, with a run time that scales as {3L.} If the number of crossovers is restricted to at most one, the run time is reduced to {L2L.} The algorithm is based on an analogue of the Fast Fourier Transform ({FFT)} and allows for arbitrary fitness functions (i.e. any epistasis). In addition, we include a streamlined individual-based framework. The library is implemented as a collection of C++ classes and a Python interface.

title = {Stochastic processes strongly influence {HIV-1} evolution during suboptimal protease-inhibitor therapy},
abstract = {It has long been assumed that HIV-1 evolution is best described by deterministic evolutionary models because of the large population size. Recently, however, it was suggested that the effective population size (Ne) may be rather small, thereby allowing chance to influence evolution, a situation best described by a stochastic evolutionary model. To gain experimental evidence supporting one of the evolutionary models, we investigated whether the development of resistance to the protease inhibitor ritonavir affected the evolution of the env gene. Sequential serum samples from five patients treated with ritonavir were used for analysis of the protease gene and the V3 domain of the env gene. Multiple reverse transcription-PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and used to construct phylogenetic trees and to calculate the genetic variation and Ne. Genotypic resistance to ritonavir developed in all five patients, but each patient displayed a unique combination of mutations, indicating a stochastic element in the development of ritonavir resistance. Furthermore, development of resistance induced clear bottleneck effects in the env gene. The mean intrasample genetic variation, which ranged from 1.2% to 5.7% before treatment, decreased significantly (P < 0.025) during treatment. In agreement with these findings, Ne was estimated to be very small (500-15,000) compared with the total HIV-1 RNA copy number. This study combines three independent observations, strong population bottlenecking, small Ne, and selection of different combinations of protease-resistance mutations, all of which indicate that HIV-1 evolution is best described by a stochastic evolutionary model.},

A complete dissection was made of the primary HIV-1-specific T cell response induced in three acutely infected patients. Cellular assays, together with new algorithms which identify sites of positive selection in the virus genome, showed that primary HIV-1-specific T cells rapidly select escape mutations concurrent with falling virus load in acute infection. Kinetic analysis and mathematical modeling of virus immune escape showed that the contribution of CD8 T cell-mediated killing of productively infected cells was earlier and much greater than previously recognized and that it contributed to the initial decline of plasma virus in acute infection. After virus escape, these first T cell responses often rapidly waned, leaving or being succeeded by T cell responses to epitopes which escaped more slowly or were invariant. These latter responses are likely to be important in maintaining the already established virus set point. In addition to mutations selected by T cells, there were other selected regions that accrued mutations more gradually but were not associated with a T cell response. These included clusters of mutations in envelope that were targeted by NAbs, a few isolated sites that reverted to the consensus sequence, and bystander mutations in linkage with T cell-driven escape.},

By comparing two sensitive measures of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the number of diverse sites measured in simulation to patient data from one-time samples of pol gene obtained by single-genome sequencing from representative untreated patients, we estimate the effective recombination rate and the average selection coefficient to be on the order of 1% per genome per generation (10(-5) per base per generation) and 0.5%, respectively. The adaptation rate is twofold higher and fourfold lower than predicted in the absence of recombination and in the limit of very frequent recombination, respectively. The level of LD and the number of diverse sites observed in data also range between the values predicted in simulation for these two limiting cases.

title = {Lower in vivo mutation rate of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 than that predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase},
abstract = {The level of genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a member of the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, is high relative to that of retroviruses in some other genera. The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection.},

title = {Dynamics of {HIV}-1 recombination in its natural target cells},
abstract = {Genetic recombination is believed to assist {HIV-1} diversification and escape from host immunity and antiviral therapies, yet this process remains largely unexamined within the natural target-cell populations. We developed a method for measuring HIV-1 recombination directly that employs reporter viruses bearing functional enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) genes in which recombination produces a modified GFP gene and GFP fluorescence in the infected cells. These reporter viruses allow simultaneous quantification of the dynamics of HIV-1 infection, coinfection, and recombination in cell culture and in animal models by flow-cytometric analysis. Multiround infection assays revealed that productive cellular coinfection was subject to little functional inhibition. As a result, generation of recombinants proceeded according to the square of the infection rate during HIV-1 replication in T lymphocytes and within human thymic grafts in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-hu (Thy/Liv) mice. These results suggest that increases in viral load may confer a compounding risk of virus escape by means of recombinational diversification. A single round of replication in T lymphocytes in culture generated an average of nine recombination events per virus, and infection of macrophages led to approximately 30 crossover events, making HIV-1 up to an order of magnitude more recombinogenic than recognized previously and demonstrating that the infected cell exerts a profound influence on the frequency of recombination.},

abstract = {A new mathematical model was used to analyze a detailed set of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) viral load data collected from five infected individuals after the administration of a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Productively infected cells were estimated to have, on average, a life-span of 2.2 days (half-life t 1/2 = 1.6 days), and plasma virions were estimated to have a mean life-span of 0.3 days (t 1/2 = 0.24 days). The estimated average total HIV-1 production was 10.3 x 10(9) virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the HIV-1 life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average HIV-1 generation time--defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles--is 2.6 days. These findings on viral dynamics provide not only a kinetic picture of HIV-1 pathogenesis, but also theoretical principles to guide the development of treatment strategies.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in controlling HIV-1 infection is vital for vaccine design. However, it is difficult to assess the importance of CTLs in natural infection. Different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles are associated with different rates of progression to AIDS, indicating that CTLs play a protective role. Yet virus clearance rates following antiretroviral therapy are not impaired in individuals with advanced HIV disease, suggesting that weakening of the CTL response is not the major underlying cause of disease progression and that CTLs do not have an important protective role. Here we reconcile these apparently conflicting studies. We estimate the selection pressure exerted by CTL responses that drive the emergence of immune escape variants, thereby directly quantifying the efficiency of HIV-1-specific CTLs in vivo. We estimate that only 2% of productively infected CD4+ cell death is attributable to CTLs recognising a single epitope. We suggest that CTLs kill a large number of infected cells (about 10(7)) per day but are not responsible for the majority of infected cell death.},

title = {Recombination rate and selection strength in {HIV} intra-patient evolution},
abstract = {The evolutionary dynamics of HIV during the chronic phase of infection is driven by the host immune response and by selective pressures exerted through drug treatment. To understand and model the evolution of HIV quantitatively, the parameters governing genetic diversification and the strength of selection need to be known. While mutation rates can be measured in single replication cycles, the relevant effective recombination rate depends on the probability of coinfection of a cell with more than one virus and can only be inferred from population data. However, most population genetic estimators for recombination rates assume absence of selection and are hence of limited applicability to HIV, since positive and purifying selection are important in HIV evolution. Yet, little is known about the distribution of selection differentials between individual viruses and the impact of single polymorphisms on viral fitness. Here, we estimate the rate of recombination and the distribution of selection coefficients from time series sequence data tracking the evolution of HIV within single patients. By examining temporal changes in the genetic composition of the population, we estimate the effective recombination to be rho = 1.4+/-0.6x10(-5) recombinations per site and generation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the selection coefficients of at least 15% of the observed non-synonymous polymorphisms exceed 0.8% per generation. These results provide a basis for a more detailed understanding of the evolution of HIV. A particularly interesting case is evolution in response to drug treatment, where recombination can facilitate the rapid acquisition of multiple resistance mutations. With the methods developed here, more precise and more detailed studies will be possible as soon as data with higher time resolution and greater sample sizes are available.},

title = {Selection for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 recombinants in a patient with rapid progression to AIDS},
abstract = {Although human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombinants have been found with high frequency, little is known about the forces that select for these viruses or their importance to pathogenesis. Here we document the emergence and dynamics of 11 distinct HIV-1 recombinants in a man who was infected with two subtype B HIV-1 strains and progressed rapidly to AIDS without developing substantial cellular or humoral immune responses. Although numerous frequency oscillations were observed, a single recombinant lineage eventually came to dominate the population. Numerical simulations indicate that the successive recombinant forms displaced each other too rapidly to be explained by any simple model of random genetic drift or sampling variation. All of the recombinants, including several resulting from independent recombination events, possessed the same sequence motif in the V3 loop, suggesting intense selection on this segment of the viral envelope protein. The outgrowth of the predominant V3 loop recombinants was not, however, associated with changes in coreceptor utilization. The final variant was instead notable for having lost 3 of 14 potential glycosylation sites. We also observed high ratios of synonymous-to-nonsynonymous nucleotide changes-suggestive of purifying selection-in all viral populations, with particularly high ratios in newly arising recombinants. Our study, therefore, illustrates the unusual and important patterns of viral adaptation that can occur in a patient with weak immune responses. Although it is hard to tease apart cause and effect in a single patient, the correlation with disease progression in this patient suggests that recombination between divergent viruses, with its ability to create chimeras with increased fitness, can accelerate progression to AIDS.},

abstract = {It has become clear that many organisms possess the ability to regulate their mutation rate in response to environmental conditions. So the question of finding an optimal mutation rate must be replaced by that of finding an optimal mutation schedule. We show that this task cannot be accomplished with standard population-dynamic models. We then develop a "hybrid" model for populations experiencing time-dependent mutation that treats population growth as deterministic but the time of first appearance of new variants as stochastic. We show that the hybrid model agrees well with a Monte Carlo simulation. From this model, we derive a deterministic approximation, a "threshold" model, that is similar to standard population dynamic models but differs in the initial rate of generation of new mutants. We use these techniques to model antibody affinity maturation by somatic hypermutation. We had previously shown that the optimal mutation schedule for the deterministic threshold model is phasic, with periods of mutation between intervals of mutation-free growth. To establish the validity of this schedule, we now show that the phasic schedule that optimizes the deterministic threshold model significantly improves upon the best constant-rate schedule for the hybrid and Monte Carlo models.},

We show in 12 acutely infected subjects (9 clade B and 3 clade C) that complete HIV-1 genomes of transmitted/founder viruses can be inferred by single genome amplification and sequencing of plasma virion RNA. This allowed for the molecular cloning and biological analysis of transmitted/founder viruses and a comprehensive genome-wide assessment of the genetic imprint left on the evolving virus quasispecies by a composite of host selection pressures. Transmitted viruses encoded intact canonical genes (gag-pol-vif-vpr-tat-rev-vpu-env-nef) and replicated efficiently in primary human CD4(+) T lymphocytes but much less so in monocyte-derived macrophages. Transmitted viruses were CD4 and CCR5 tropic and demonstrated concealment of coreceptor binding surfaces of the envelope bridging sheet and variable loop 3. 2 mo after infection, transmitted/founder viruses in three subjects were nearly completely replaced by viruses differing at two to five highly selected genomic loci; by 12-20 mo, viruses exhibited concentrated mutations at 17-34 discrete locations. These findings reveal viral properties associated with mucosal HIV-1 transmission and a limited set of rapidly evolving adaptive mutations driven primarily, but not exclusively, by early cytotoxic T cell responses.},

title = {Beneficial mutation selection balance and the effect of linkage on positive selection},
abstract = {When beneficial mutations are rare, they accumulate by a series of selective sweeps. But when they are common, many beneficial mutations will occur before any can fix, so there will be many different mutant lineages in the population concurrently. In an asexual population, these different mutant lineages interfere and not all can fix simultaneously. In addition, further beneficial mutations can accumulate in mutant lineages while these are still a minority of the population. In this article, we analyze the dynamics of such multiple mutations and the interplay between multiple mutations and interference between clones. These result in substantial variation in fitness accumulating within a single asexual population. The amount of variation is determined by a balance between selection, which destroys variation, and beneficial mutations, which create more. The behavior depends in a subtle way on the population parameters: the population size, the beneficial mutation rate, and the distribution of the fitness increments of the potential beneficial mutations. The mutation-selection balance leads to a continually evolving population with a steady-state fitness variation. This variation increases logarithmically with both population size and mutation rate and sets the rate at which the population accumulates beneficial mutations, which thus also grows only logarithmically with population size and mutation rate. These results imply that mutator phenotypes are less effective in larger asexual populations. They also have consequences for the advantages (or disadvantages) of sex via the Fisher-Muller effect; these are discussed briefly.},
